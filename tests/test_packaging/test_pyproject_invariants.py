"""Invariants for pyproject.toml after the 0.1.0 release refactor.

The refactor moves real-used channel SDKs into base dependencies, deletes
dead extras (msteams / matrix), and turns the remaining channel extras
into empty backward-compat aliases. These tests assert those invariants
so the configuration cannot silently regress.
